Exercise 3

Review the FastAPI tutorial (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) carefully and use it to build a simple REST API for managing a collection of books in a library.

Endpoints requirements.
- Create a book
    Endpoint: POST /books/
    Request body:
    {
        "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer",
        "author": "Andrew Hunt",
        "year": 1999,
        "isbn": "978-0201616224"
    }
    Response: Return the created book with a unique ID.
- Read all books
    Endpoint: GET /books/
    Response: List all stored books.
- Read a single book by ID
    Endpoint: GET /books/{book_id}
    Response: Return the book with that ID or an error if not found.
- Update a book
    Endpoint: PUT /books/{book_id}
    Request body: Same as creation.
    Response: Return the updated book.
- Delete a book
    Endpoint: DELETE /books/{book_id}
    Response: Confirm deletion.

Moreover, find a way to integrate the requests and pandas libraries into your solution. Use your creativity.
